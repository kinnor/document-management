# React Frontend

This directory contains the React application bootstrapped with
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). The project keeps a simple folder structure:

```
src/
  components/   reusable UI components
  pages/        application pages
  services/     API calls and external integrations
  utils/        helper utilities
```

Run the development server from this folder:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
